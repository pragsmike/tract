I went to lunch today with family who were in town for a wedding. Instead of only focusing on catching up, I also had to update them on the severity and location of the violent protests that were intentionally being sparked by anonymous fascist stormtroopers nearby. We were outside and saw a number of military helicopters fly by and a constant stream of sirens and news choppers covering the mayhem.

Apparently, they were bringing in weaponry and ammunition on Blackhawks to wield against protesters.
This was sparked by ICE raids Friday [throughout Los Angeles](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/multiple-immigration-enforcement-operations-los-angeles-ice/)that were intentionally designed to traumatize and outrage residents.
I‚Äôve lived in Los Angeles for fifteen years after moving from San Francisco, where I landed the year of the Rodney King riots in 1992. By contrast, LA is not really a city, it‚Äôs a sprawling metropolis with a huge disparity in everything from economy to climate. It‚Äôs more like a small country than a city. In many ways, it is a microcosm of America.
After the fires tore through LA and Trump took the opportunity to attack us and threatened our disaster relief, I had the feeling we would be the first real test of his desire to turn America into a militarized dictatorship. And so it is.
Trump signed a [Presidential Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/department-of-defense-security-for-the-protection-of-department-of-homeland-security-functions/)ordering 2,000 National Guard troops to be sent into Los Angeles.

Trump is also, according to Gavin Newsom, federalizing the California National Guard, which is something Newsom [could refuse](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/presidents-power-call-out-national-guard-not-blank-check#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Crequest%E2%80%9D%20in%20%C2%A7,point%20is%20discussed%20further%20below), but is seemingly going along with it anyway.

Drunk rapist crusader Pete Hegseth is frothing at the mouth to send in not just National Guard but *active duty*US Marines.
> ‚ÄúIf violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized.‚Äù

This is a violation of the [Posse Comitatus Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act), but Trump‚Äôs regime has already violated it. Hegseth will have no hesitation.
This is all an intentional provocation, of course, because Trump wants to show how ‚Äústrong‚Äù he is. It‚Äôs not good enough to have a Moscow-style military parade to show off, he also wants to deploy troops against his own people. These howitzers are rolling in by rail today to DC, while the Blackhawks are flying into LA.
Trump, for his part, did a Truth about all this and went to UFC to schmooze with wife-beater Dana White and propagandist Joe Rogan instead of dealing with what he‚Äôs done to the country, and to my city.

The LAPD issued this press release tonight, which praises the peaceful protesters, says it is fully prepared to respond to any unrest, and that the protests have concluded. This is clearly an effort to signal to the federal government that their military interference is not needed or welcome, despite the fact that there are still protests going on tonight.

This is an ongoing test of the regime‚Äôs ability to exercise state violence against those it wants to disappear or oppress. I am very proud of my city for the spontaneous protests and the defense of our residents. And while I am horrified that Trump has picked my town for this test, I‚Äôm confident that LA will pass it. We‚Äôve seen worse.
I know there is a lot of fear out there, but the most important thing to remember when the unthinkable happens is not to panic. That is what they want. Don‚Äôt give it to them.
Be smart. Be safe. But do not let fear paralyze you. Exercise your rights or you will lose them. We will get through this together.
*Long live a free America. Heroyam Slava.*
