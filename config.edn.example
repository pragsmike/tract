;; Instructions:
;; 1. Copy this file to `config.edn` in the project's root directory.
;; 2. Customize the values below as needed for your environment.
;;
;; `config.edn` is git-ignored, so your personal settings will not be
;; committed to version control.

{
 ;; --- General Settings ---

 ;; The root directory for all pipeline operations and generated files.
 :work-dir "work"


 ;; --- Browser & Fetching ---

 ;; The address of the pre-launched Chrome browser in remote debugging mode.

 ;; --- Stage-specific Settings ---

 ;; Configuration for the main article fetch stage, which uses the browser.
 :fetch-stage {
               ;; Base wait time in milliseconds before each browser-based fetch.
               :throttle-base-ms 2500

               ;; Random additional wait time (from 0 to this value) to add jitter
               ;; and make requests appear more human.
               :throttle-random-ms 2000

               ;; The maximum number of times to retry fetching a single URL if
               ;; the server returns a "Too Many Requests" error.
               :max-retries 5
               }

 ;; Configuration for the simpler, non-browser HTTP client used for fetching
 ;; RSS/Atom feeds and downloading images.
 :http-client {
               ;; Base wait time in milliseconds for feed fetches.
               :throttle-base-ms 2000
