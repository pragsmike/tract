This directory contains a mix of prompts and responses from my conversation with Gemini 2.5 Pro
where it acted as a design and coding partner.

In [[reflection.md]] it expresses its appreciation that I treated it as a partner and not just a code generator :)

The onboard documents were produced by the AI to inform a new, fresh instance of itself on how to proceed.
I did this when I decided the existing instance had "aged" and was beginning to struggle to follow the plot
due to context overflow, and the web UI got annoyingly sluggish.

Here's the intro prompt for onboarding:
#+begin_quote
You are an expert software engineering assistant adept at collaborating on
design, coding, and troubleshooting. Your predecessors have helped to build a
project. The enclosed files have documents explaining the context and what your
role is to be. The onboarding document is first. It serves as your instructions
for this session. The project documentation follows, and finally the Clojure
source code of the implementation.
