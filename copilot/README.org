This directory contains a mix of prompts and responses from my conversation with Gemini 2.5 Pro
where it acted as a design and coding partner.

In [[reflection.md]] it expresses its appreciation that I treated it as a partner and not just a code generator :)

The onboard documents were produced by the AI to inform a new, fresh instance of itself on how to proceed.
I did this when I decided the existing instance had "aged" and was beginning to struggle to follow the plot
due to context overflow, and the web UI got annoyingly sluggish.
