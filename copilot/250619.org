The next refactoring is to keep the HTML files in a directory work/html,
similarly to how the metadata files are keps in work/metadata,
where they will remain forever without being moved.
Their names and contents will be the same as they are now.
We must avoid having partial files, so the fetch stage must download
to a temporary file, and only after it is known to be completely
downloaded will we rename it into the work/html directory.

The workflow is only slightly changed from what it is now. Instead of placing
the html files into work/parser/pending, the fetch stage will leave the
downloaded file in work/html, and it will then create a symlink to the
downloaded file in work/parser/pending.

I don't expect any changes to the parser stage, because it will
be reading and renaming a symlink instead of the actual html file,
but it won't know or care that it's a symlink.
The parser will simply open the symlink, and the operating system will follow it automatically
to provide the contents of the file.
When the parser completes work on an HTML file, it moves the symlink
to the work/parser/done or work/parser/error directory, as appropriate.
The symlink will still point to the same file in work/html.

We must take care to construct the symlink so that this is true.
It could use a relative path, as it will then be valid if placed
in any directory at the same level in the hierarchy.

Do you see any problems with this approach?  What other things
might break if the files in work/parser/* are symlinks rather than actual files?
Will other namespaces beside fetch need to chage?  Any of the scripts?

Next let's make a script that verifies the integrity of the source-of-truth
parts of the corpus: work/html and work/metadata.
These are now immutable and the files won't move.
The code takes great care not to put these in an inconsistent state,
but it can still happen that html and metadata files don't both exist,
or that their contents don't agree, for causes we can't control.
Create a script that verifies this.
Remember that all keys found in the metadata file are kebab case.
Here's a sample:
{
  "source-url": "https://www.mind-war.com/p/why-is-a-canadian-it-guy-trying-to",
  "fetch-timestamp": "2025-06-14T14:13:21.778821106Z"
}
and the corresponding html file has this directory listing:
 ls -l work/html/why-is-a-canadian-it-guy-trying-to.html
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mg mg 292036 Jun 14 10:13 work/html/why-is-a-canadian-it-guy-trying-to.html
