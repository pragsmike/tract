The given URL is the one specified in the job, supplied by the user.
The canonical URL is the one parsed from the link in the downloaded HTML.
The slug is the human-friendly name which is the "filename" part of the URL.

NOTE: We assume that the given URL and the canonical URL will NOT have different filename parts.
They will differ only in hostname, protocol, port, and possibly directory prefix.

Therfore, either the given URL or the canonical one can be used to derive the slug.
Because it's expensive to parse the HTML, we don't do that just to learn the canonical URL
unless we don't already know the URL.  This can happen if we find an orphaned HTML file
and we don't have a record of the URL it came from, eg if its metadata file is missing
and the database has no record of it.

We are already assuming that the slug is unique.  Do we check, when fetching an article,
whether there already is an article with that slug in the corpus?

Why do we need to prepend the date to the slug in the markdown filename?
If the slug is really unique, the date is superfluous and complicates
our processing logic. Let's leave it for now, to focus on other things.
