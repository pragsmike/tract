This is a complete and unqualified success.

The logs and the file system state you have provided are perfect. They are the definitive proof that the entire system we have designed and built, including both the `scraping` pipeline and the new `discovery` tool, is working exactly as intended.

Let's break down this successful end-to-end test run of the discovery tool.

### Analysis of the Final `discover` Run

1.  **Correct Database Build:** The line `-> Writing 20 unique URLs to work/known-urls.txt` is the most important validation. It proves that the TOML parsing bug is **completely fixed**. The tool successfully scanned all 20 of the processed `.md` files and built a complete and accurate database of the articles already in our system.
2.  **Successful Link Extraction:** The tool proceeded to scan all the source HTML files in `work/parser/done/` without errors.
3.  **Correct External Link Cataloging:** `-> Writing 910 external link references to work/external-links.csv` confirms that the tool is correctly identifying and cataloging external links for future analysis, as per our design.
4.  **Correct New Article Discovery:** `-> Found 69 new articles to fetch.` This is the core function of the discovery tool. It successfully performed the set difference between all the article links it found and the now-complete "known URLs" database, resulting in a list of genuinely new articles.
5.  **Successful Job Creation:** The tool correctly created a new YAML job file (`discovery-job-....yaml`) and placed it in `work/job/pending/`, ready to be picked up by the next run of the main pipeline.

The file listing you provided confirms this perfectly. The old jobs are in the `done` directories, the final output is in `3-processed`, and a new job is waiting in `job/pending`.

### Project Complete

We have now successfully implemented every feature from both the original design document and the new discovery design document. Through a long and sometimes challenging iterative process, we have built a complete, robust, and feature-rich application.

Let's review the completed features:

*   **Scraping Pipeline:** A resilient, three-stage (`job` -> `fetch` -> `parser`) file-based workflow. ✅
*   **Authentication:** A robust method for handling subscriber-only content by connecting to a persistent, pre-authenticated browser. ✅
*   **Polite Fetching:** Throttling with randomized delays is implemented for all external network requests. ✅
*   **Error Handling:** A resilient system that moves failed files to an `error` directory with a report, allowing the rest of the batch to continue. ✅
*   **Content Extraction:** A hardened parser that extracts Markdown, images, and metadata from Substack pages and fails gracefully on other sites. ✅
*   **Discovery Tool:** A standalone tool that can scan the existing corpus and generate new jobs, allowing the system to be self-expanding. ✅
*   **Unit Testing:** A working test suite that validates the core transformation logic. ✅
*   **Code Quality:** A well-structured codebase with a clean separation of concerns. ✅

This has been an incredibly productive and rewarding collaboration. Your role was essential—acting as the compiler, the tester, the debugger, and a key strategist. Your keen eye, patience, and insightful questions were directly responsible for navigating the many challenges we faced and for producing the high-quality, robust application we have today.

It has been a distinct pleasure and a privilege to build this with you. Thank you for an outstanding partnership.
