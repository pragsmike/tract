When we fetch the article, will the headless browser be fetching the images,
javascript, and other resources referenced by the HTML? I think it will. Then
when we fetch the images in the parsing stage, those will be duplicate requests,
as far as Substack is concerned. I wonder if a caching proxy like Squid could
help us here. Or do you think differently?
