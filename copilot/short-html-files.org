Sometimes, during fetch, the web server will refuse the request, but won't return 429 status.
Instead, the web server will return a web page that contains only the text Too Many Requests plus some markup.
I'm going to call these "short pages".

Beware that some pages that arrived normally
also contain that string, as part of their JavaScript, perhaps as some sort of error-handling code;
such pages are not to be considered short pages.

Apparently the web site does not send the status 429 when this happens,
so we don't detect it, and the page gets processed as if it were normal.
Here's a sample.  Some of the short pages have other markup, but they all contain that text.
This was the file brad.html:
<html><head><meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark"></head><body><pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">Too Many Requests</pre></body></html>

I want to do two things:
  * find a way to detect the short page as soon as it's downloaded, before considering it a successful fetch,
    and treat is the same as a 429 response.
  * find a way to identify what URL produced a given short page, and create a job to fetch just those URLs.
    We might have to brute-force this by taking the list of fetched URLs, deriving the name of the HTML file,
    and comparing it to the short file's name.
