I'd like to structure the final workflow as a sequence of steps,
where the steps communicate via files in directories. Each step would have a
pair of input directories: pending and done. For example, the first step would
read a job file in its pending directory to find out what URLs are to be
fetched, fetch them, and put the HTML in the next step's pending directory where
the next step will find it, and then move the job file into its "done"
directory. This way, the existing code that reads from a file can still do that.
This makes it easy to test. In the future, we'll add the step that produces that
file by fetching from a URL, independently of the existing code. We'll work out
the details of the file-coordinated workflow later, including error handling.
For now, I just want to make sure our refactoring we're about to do remains
based on reading from files.
